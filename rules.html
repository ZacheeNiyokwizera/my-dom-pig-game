                    #GAME RULES: - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds <br> - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes.<br> Each result get added to his ROUND score<br> - BUT, if the player rolls a 1 in a row, all his ROUND
                    score gets lost.<br> After that, it's the next player's turn<br> - A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row.<br> After that, it's the next player's turn.<br> - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that
                    his ROUND score<br> gets added to his GL0BAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn<br> - Inside the input field you can the change the default final score from<br> 100 to the one of your choice.<br> - The first player to reach
                    the final score on GLOBAL score wins<br> the game.
